            <p>Facts About The Dubai Visa Refund Policy</p>
            <p>
              The Dubai visa refund is not for unsuccessful visas, according to
              the authorities of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Dubai visa
              refund policy is only sometimes applicable. If your visa gets
              rejected, you cannot take a refund, which will waste your money.
              Suppose you apply for a Dubai visa online from our website. When
              you apply for your visa from Dubai E Visa Online, the chances of
              your visa getting rejected reduce significantly. You can look at
              the reviews for yourself if you want to.

              When Can You Apply For The Dubai Visa Refund Policy?
            </p>
            <p>
              As you know, you can only request a refund if your visa is
              accepted. If the Dubai government rejects your visa, there might
              be some valid explainable reason for it.{" "}

            <p>
              You must remember the following things if you want to apply for
              the Dubai visa refund policy. They are:{" "}
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Suppose you change your decision after applying for the Dubai
                visa and want to avoid taking the visa. You can cancel the visa
                in two hours. If you do so, the Dubai visa refund works and your
                fees will be returned.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you nullify your application for the Dubai visa after one day
                or twenty-four hours or post 02 hours of applying, no amount
                will be refunded.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you cancel your Dubai visa application one day, i.e.,
                within twenty-four hours, the website or the agency already
                forwards the application to the Embassy. Hence, no visa fees are
                refunded.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the Embassy of the UAE itself rejects your visa application,
                there is no way that your money will be returned. The main
                reason that the Embassy rejects your visa application is because
                of your need for proper documents.

            <p>Recent Developments About The Dubai Tourist Visas</p>
            <p>
              The Dubai government cancelled all the newly approved visas
              (applied or approved around March) due to COVID-19 or the infamous
              Coronavirus pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people are curious about the refund of these cancelled
              tourist visas. A few people are still determining if they will get
              another visa in replacement for the cancelled one. According to
              the GDRFA (General Directory of Residency and Foreign Affairs),
              you will not obtain any visa in return or replacement of the
              cancelled visa. You will need to get back the money from your visa
              application.
